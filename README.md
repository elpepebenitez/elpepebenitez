### Hello World 👋

Greetings from Panama ☀️ I decided to do a career transition from Law, so I took a web development coding bootcamp in London back in 2020 and embarked in my path as a developer. I enjoy coding a lot, but I still have so much to learn! 👨‍🚀 

#### Skills/languages

Full Stack Dev. React & Vue. Ruby & Rails. Node & Express. SQL & Mongo. Firebase + Heroku. Javascript, HTML & CSS.

#### Learning/exploring

Currently learning a lot about Express and Node.

#### Projects

I am currently working on a startup related to legal tech (<a href="https://temis.dev" target="_blank"> Temis.dev </a>)
as well as tailor made web applications for entrepreneurs.

I also teach javascript and NodeJS to amazing students at <a href="https://uncommon.org/" target="_blank"> Uncommon.org </a>

#### Available for...

If you need a web application or want to explore automating a process let me know!

I also love to teach 🤓

Happy to chat or collaborate about using technology to improve society, or talk to anyone thinking about making a career transition or joining a coding bootcamp.
