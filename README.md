### Hello World 👋

Greetings from Panama ☀️ I decided last year to do a career transition from Law, so I recently finished a web development coding bootcamp in London and I am taking my first steps in my path as a developer. I enjoy coding a lot, but I still have so much to learn! 👨‍🚀 

#### Skills/languages

Full Stack Dev. Ruby & Rails. Javascript & Vue. SQL. Firebase + Heroku. HTML & CSS.

#### Learning/trying

Currently learning a lot about Vue, Javascript and Firebase. Soon will be starting with React.

#### Projects

I am currently working on my own projects related to legal tech and social impact.

#### Available for...

Main focus is legal tech atm. Happy to talk or collaborate about using technology to improve society, or talk to anyone thinking about making a career transition or joining a coding bootcamp.
