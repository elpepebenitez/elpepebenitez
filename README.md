### Hello World 👋

<!--- Greetings from Panama ☀️ -->
In the crazy year of 2020 I decided to explore a career transition from Law and International Development, so I took a web development coding bootcamp in London and embarked in a path as a developer. It is one of the best decisions I have made! 

Nowadays I combine my formal background and my technical skills to better understand the world around me, and come up with solutions to problems 👨‍🚀

Currently I am a Chevening Scholar studying a MSc in Development Management with a specialism in Applied Development Economics at The London School of Economics and Political Science 🤓

Happy to chat or collaborate about using technology to improve society, or talk to anyone thinking about making a career transition or joining a coding bootcamp.
